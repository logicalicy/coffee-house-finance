<h2>What is Coffee House Finance?</h2>
<p>Coffee House Finance aims to solve a problem many of us investors have when managing portfolios at numerous brokers, banks and/or even countries! While you may have individual apps to monitor each of your separate portfolios, wouldn't it be nice to have the information all in one place? You can certainly use a plain old spreadsheet to manage all your portfolios. But this website aims to let you track your portfolios and their performance all in one place.</p>
